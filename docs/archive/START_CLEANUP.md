# 🎯 START HERE - Clean Up Your Project

Your project works, but it's cluttered with troubleshooting files!

## Quick Cleanup (30 seconds)

**Just double-click this file:**
```
CLEANUP.bat
```

This will organize everything into proper folders.

## What It Does

- ✅ Moves 20+ temp docs to `docs/archive/`
- ✅ Moves 15+ temp scripts to `scripts/archive/`
- ✅ Keeps only essential files in root
- ✅ Creates clean structure

## After Cleanup

Your project will be clean and professional:

```
youtube-video-chat-app/
├── README.md              ← Clean documentation
├── QUICK_REFERENCE.md     ← Essential commands
├── docker-compose.yml
├── mix.exs
├── assets/                ← Your code
├── lib/                   ← Your code
├── config/
└── docs/
    └── archive/           ← Old files (safe to delete later)
```

## Then What?

After cleanup, use these files:
- **README.md** - Main documentation
- **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Quick commands

## Your App Still Works!

Nothing breaks - we're just organizing files.
Your queue system is working perfectly!
